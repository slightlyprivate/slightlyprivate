This repository is the hub for personal projects, past work, and ideas in progress.

## Current Project

- **[PetCare Companion](https://github.com/slightlyprivate/petcare-companion)** — a Laravel REST API for pet and appointment management. This is my active project where I'm focusing on real-world utility and improved workflows for pet care providers and owners.

## Past Projects

- **[Cosmic Blueprint](https://github.com/slightlyprivate/cosmic-blueprint)** — an offline Python toolkit for computing natal charts and doing astrological analysis.
- **[CSV Dashgen](https://github.com/slightlyprivate/csv-dashgen)** — a TypeScript app that turns CSV files into dynamic interactive dashboards.

## Identity

- **[Whoami](https://github.com/slightlyprivate/whoami)** — a personal identity portal built with Vite + TypeScript; a privacy-focused digital calling card and mini-portfolio.

## Upcoming Projects

- Slightly Better Luck — a small experimental project exploring probabilistic utilities and user-facing microservices.
- Slightly Better US — an idea for civic or community-focused tooling to improve local engagement and outcomes.
